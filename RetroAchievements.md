# Retroachievements

  > Because of lack of a keyboard, there is no way to set up [RetroAchievements](http://retroachievements.org/) in RetroArch, but it can be done by editing retroarch.cfg.

* `sudo nano /opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg`

* Add following strings in to the end of this file:

```
cheevos_username = "yourusername"
cheevos_password = "yourpassword"
cheevos_enable = true
```

[Ctrl+O] (to save) [Enter] and [Ctrl+X] (to exit)
