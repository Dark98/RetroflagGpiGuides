# Super Mario All Stars Controls fix

  > There's an old bug that switches player 1 and 2 on this game, and since GPi uses SNES9X2002 the bug is still present. Fortunately the fix is easy

* Go into Retroarch in the game (Select + X)
* then go to settings, input, user 2 binds, user 2 device index
* press left to set it to Microsoft X-Box 360 pad
* then you'll want to go to Quick Menu/Overrides/Save Game Override.

This will make you control player 1 and 2 simultaneously but it doesn't hurt anything if you're playing single player.
