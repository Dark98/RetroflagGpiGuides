# Scummvm information

## Thanks to Kev Rose

 > Scummvm works great (I've tested the talkie versions of monkey island 1&2, curse of monkey island, Beavis & Butthead etc.
 
 * For scummvm Install lr-scummvm (experimental?)
 
 * place your games within folders into the scummvm folder in: `retropie/roms/scummvm/`
 
 * rename your game's folder (say monkeyisland) to monkeyisland.svm for it to show in EmulationStation.

## Controls:
If you press start or select in-game it brings up the scummvm menu for saving. Start and select quits.
