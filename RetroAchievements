Because of lack of a keyboard, there is no way to set up RetroAchievements (http://retroachievements.org/) in RetroArch, but it can be done by editing retroarch.cfg.

Open /opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg

Add following strings in to the end of this file:

cheevos_username = "yourusername"
cheevos_password = "yourpassword"
cheevos_enable = true
