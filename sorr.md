steps

steps

## Savegame.sor (*required!*)
> The save game file will help you get it running properly by setting the correct controls and video mode.
Pick either the standard (nothing is unlocked, you unlock things by playing) or the fully unlocked version, but not both.  Run the command that corrosponds to your preference:

### Standard (Nothing unlocked) Savegame:

```
mkdir -p /opt/retropie/configs/ports/sorr/ && wget -O /opt/retropie/configs/ports/sorr/savegame.sor https://github.com/SinisterSpatula/SuperRetropieGuides/raw/master/data/sorr/savegame.sor
```

### -OR-

### Fully unlocked Savegame:
```
mkdir -p /opt/retropie/configs/ports/sorr/ && wget -O /opt/retropie/configs/ports/sorr/savegame.sor https://github.com/SinisterSpatula/SuperRetropieGuides/raw/master/data/sorr/savegame_unlocked.sor
```



## Controls:
First, make sure you have migrated to the new controller framework by [following the steps here](https://github.com/SinisterSpatula/Gpi)
Or if you have already migrated, then just go to Controllertools then Control_Updater_Menu, then do option 1 (update controls).
Also, make sure you installed one of the savegames from above.
